### Notes
The most tedious part of the assignment was importing the images using cocoapods. Prior to this project, I wasn't very familiar with terminal commands so installing cocoapods was difficult. After that hurdle, however, everything else came easy such as importing AlamoFireImage in order to display the movie posters in the app and making final edits to the design of the app.
